  **Design Movement**: **Swiss Style (International Typographic Style) Modernized**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Objective Clarity**: Content is king. The news and data should be presented with absolute precision and minimal distraction.
  2.  **Grid Systems**: A strict, mathematical grid layout to organize the "10 point newspaper" structure effectively.
  3.  **Asymmetry**: Use asymmetrical layouts to create visual interest and guide the eye through the hierarchy of news.
  4.  **Whitespace as Structure**: Heavy use of negative space to separate sections without borders.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Palette**: Stark White (#FFFFFF) background, Deep Charcoal (#1A1A1A) for text, and a single, bold accent color: **International Orange** (#FF4F00) (a nod to the Golden Gate Bridge).
  *   **Intent**: High contrast for readability. The orange accent draws attention to key metrics (market pulse) and call-to-actions without overwhelming the professional tone.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  *   **Modular Dashboard**: The homepage feels like a sophisticated dashboard. The "Top 10" list isn't just a list; it's a grid of cards where the most important news takes up 2x2 modules, while others are 1x1.
  *   **Sticky Navigation**: A side-aligned or persistent top bar that keeps the "Market Pulse" data always visible.

  **Signature Elements**:
  *   **Grotesque Typography**: Large, bold, sans-serif headers (like Helvetica Now or Inter tight) for impact.
  *   **Data Visualization Micro-interactions**: Small sparkline charts next to news items indicating trends (up/down).
  *   **Geometric Dividers**: Thick, bold lines separating the header from the content.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **Hover-to-Reveal**: Cards are clean initially; hovering reveals the summary and "read more" link.
  *   **Snap Scrolling**: Smooth scrolling that snaps to the next news item or section for a deliberate reading pace.

  **Animation**:
  *   **Staggered Reveal**: News items slide in from the bottom with a slight delay between each (staggered by 50ms).
  *   **Sharp Transitions**: No soft fades; elements move with quick, precise easing (cubic-bezier).

  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headings**: **Unbounded** (Bold/Black) - for a modern, almost architectural feel.
  *   **Body**: **DM Sans** - highly readable geometric sans-serif.

  **Design Movement**: **Editorial Brutalism / Neo-Newspaper**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Raw & Honest**: Exposing the structure. Lines, borders, and monospaced fonts that evoke the feeling of a raw data feed or a printed financial paper.
  2.  **Information Density**: Embracing a dense layout that respects the user's intelligence and need for speed.
  3.  **High Contrast**: Stark black and white with no greys.
  4.  **Serif & Mono Mix**: Combining the authority of traditional serif fonts with the technical feel of monospaced code fonts.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Palette**: Off-white/Newsprint (#F6F4EF) background, Ink Black (#050505) text, and a muted **Bay Blue** (#2B4C7E) for links/highlights.
  *   **Intent**: To mimic the tactile feel of a premium newspaper or financial journal. Trustworthy, established, and serious.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  *   **Masonry Grid**: A masonry layout for the news items, allowing articles of different lengths to fit naturally together like a collage.
  *   **Split Screen**: The desktop view splits the screen: Left side is the scrollable news feed (The Pulse), Right side is sticky static market data (The Stats).

  **Signature Elements**:
  *   **Visible Grid Lines**: Thin 1px borders around every content block.
  *   **Typewriter Aesthetic**: Dates and metadata in monospaced fonts.
  *   **Oversized Serifs**: Massive, elegant serif numbers (1-10) for the news list.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **Paper Tactility**: Subtle grain textures.
  *   **Marquee Banners**: A slow-scrolling ticker tape at the top with live market stats (Interest rates, Median Price).

  **Animation**:
  *   **Typewriter Effect**: Headlines appear character-by-character (very fast) on load.
  *   **Page Turn**: Transitions between pages feel like sliding a sheet of paper.

  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headings**: **Playfair Display** (Italic/Regular) - for that classic editorial look.
  *   **Body**: **Lora** - a contemporary serif with roots in calligraphy.
  *   **Data/Meta**: **JetBrains Mono** or **Space Mono**.

  **Design Movement**: **Glassmorphism & California Light**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Translucency & Depth**: Using frosted glass effects to layer content over beautiful, blurred imagery of Bay Area landscapes.
  2.  **Softness & Approachability**: Rounded corners, soft shadows, and a feeling of "airiness."
  3.  **Nature-Inspired**: Connecting the real estate market back to the physical location—the beautiful Bay Area.
  4.  **Fluidity**: Layouts that feel organic and flow into one another.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Palette**: Soft Gradients of **Eucalyptus Green** (#8FBC8F) to **Pacific Mist** (#E0F7FA). Backgrounds are white with low opacity (glass). Text is Dark Slate (#2F4F4F).
  *   **Intent**: To evoke the lifestyle of the Bay Area—fresh, modern, and desirable. It makes the market data feel less intimidating and more lifestyle-oriented.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  *   **Floating Cards**: Content lives on white, semi-transparent cards floating above a subtle, slow-moving background video or gradient.
  *   **Central Focus**: A single-column feed for the news, optimized for mobile scrolling, with market data widgets floating in the margins on desktop.

  **Signature Elements**:
  *   **Frosted Glass (Backdrop-filter)**: Used on the navigation bar and market data widgets.
  *   **Soft Gradients**: Backgrounds are not solid colors but subtle, shifting gradients.
  *   **Rounded Iconography**: Friendly, filled icons for categories.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **Parallax**: Background moves slower than the foreground cards to create depth.
  *   **Soft Hover**: Cards gently lift and glow (box-shadow increase) when hovered.

  **Animation**:
  *   **Fade & Float**: Elements fade in and float upwards into position.
  *   **Blur In**: Images load from blurry to sharp.

  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headings**: **Outfit** - a beautiful, geometric sans-serif with friendly curves.
  *   **Body**: **Nunito** or **Lato** - rounded and easy on the eyes.
